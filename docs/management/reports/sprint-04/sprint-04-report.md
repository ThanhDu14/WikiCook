## 1. SPRINT 04 OVERVIEW & JIRA BACKLOG
*Performed by: Lê Quốc Hưng (LqHung06) | Reviewed by: Nguyễn Đức Duy (DucDuyNguyen15-IT) | Edited by: Lê Quốc Hưng (LqHung06)*

### 1.1. Sprint 04 Goal & Scope (`PA4-2026` — Updated rubric: 90 points)
*Performed by: Lê Quốc Hưng (LqHung06) | Reviewed by: Nguyễn Đức Duy (DucDuyNguyen15-IT) | Edited by: Lê Quốc Hưng (LqHung06)*

Sprint 04 is planned to complete the PA4-2026 submission. The updated assignment brief lists 90 points across six parts: Part A, revised use-case documents and `Changes.md` (5 points); Part B, Tech Stack and C4 Level 1 System Context (20); Part C, C4 Level 2 Container and Level 3 Component diagrams (25); Part D, Deployment Diagram (5); Part E, two Spec Kit-driven full-stack functional groups, generated tests and narrated video demo (30); and Part F, AI Usage and Weekly Reports (5).

The team selected the following two Part E groups for implementation:

1. **F-01 — User Authentication & Dietary Profile:** specs `010-user-authentication-roles` and `011-user-profile-dietary`.
2. **F-07 — Social Cooksnaps & Reviews:** spec `070-review-cooksnap`.

The Sprint 4 Jira backlog contains the corresponding Spec Kit and implementation tasks. Per PA4, both groups are expected to cover UI, API/business logic, persistence, generated tests and a narrated video demo.

The architecture diagrams must describe the actual implementation and deployment configuration at submission time. Planned modules or external services must not be represented as implemented unless verified in the repository/configuration.

### 1.2. Sprint 04 Jira Backlog — SCRUM-68 to SCRUM-90
*Performed by: Lê Quốc Hưng (LqHung06) | Reviewed by: Nguyễn Đức Duy (DucDuyNguyen15-IT) | Edited by: Lê Quốc Hưng (LqHung06)*

The Sprint 4 Jira backlog shown in the screenshots provided by the user contains **23 work items**, `SCRUM-68`–`SCRUM-90`. The visible issue summaries, assignees (identified by the user from Jira avatars), statuses and due dates were compared with the team assignment plan. The screenshot shows the issues in `To Do` at capture time; that status is not represented as completion. Reviewer fields are not visible in the screenshots and should be checked in each Jira issue.

\* **Date discrepancy:** The Jira screenshot shows `SCRUM-89` due 23/11/2026, while the team assignment file lists 19/11/2026. This report reflects the visible Jira date; update the assignment file if 23/11 is the approved due date. The screenshot does not show reviewer fields, so reviewers should be verified in Jira issue details.

## 2. SCRUM MEETING MINUTES

### 2.1. Meeting 1: Sprint 04 Planning (`SCRUM-68`)
*Performed by: Lê Quốc Hưng (LqHung06) | Reviewed by: Nguyễn Đức Duy (DucDuyNguyen15-IT) | Edited by: Lê Quốc Hưng (LqHung06)*

The user confirmed that Sprint 4 Planning took place. The decisions and backlog details below are recorded from the user's confirmation, the approved PA4 assignment plan and the Jira backlog screenshots supplied in this conversation. Meeting time, platform, attendee list and discussion transcript were not supplied, so they are not inferred here.

- **Date:** 10/11/2026 (Sprint 4 start date in the assignment plan; user confirms the planning meeting has occurred on this date).
- **Time / platform:** Not recorded in the available evidence.
- **Attendees:** Not recorded in the available evidence.
- **Facilitator / minute taker:** Lê Quốc Hưng (`@LqHung06`), SCRUM-68 assignee.
- **Meeting objective:** Review PA4 requirements, select implementation scope, distribute work and establish the Sprint 4 Jira backlog.

#### Discussion and decisions

1. **PA4 scope:** The updated PA4 brief totals 90 points and includes revised use-case documents (A), architecture diagrams (B–D), two Spec Kit-driven end-to-end functional groups with generated tests and narrated demo (E), and AI/Weekly reporting (F).
2. **Part E group selection:** The team selected **F-01 (`010` Authentication + `011` Profile & Dietary Profile)** and **F-07 (`070` Reviews & Cooksnap)**. Both are planned as full-stack groups; the delivery needs to demonstrate UI, API/business logic and persistence.
3. **Jira backlog:** The screenshots show 23 work items, `SCRUM-68`–`SCRUM-90`, with the task summaries and assignee avatars. The user confirmed that they can identify the Jira avatars as the respective members. The visible items were in `To Do` when captured; that status is preserved as shown, not interpreted as task completion.
4. **Workload distribution:** Planned author counts are Hưng 5, Duy 5, Hiển 5, Chung 4, Dự 4 tasks, meeting the agreed target of 4–5 SCRUM tasks per person.
5. **Architecture quality constraint:** C4 diagrams are to describe the real source/configuration at submission time; unimplemented modules must not be presented as implemented.
6. **Submission target:** The working plan uses 23/11/2026 as the final date. Confirm the official date/time in Moodle or the assignment instructions before submission.

#### Jira backlog review and follow-up

The screenshots show backlog summaries and assignee avatars, but not issue descriptions/reviewers. SCRUM-89 is displayed with a due date of 23/11/2026 in the screenshot, whereas the team-assignment file has 19/11/2026; the live Jira date is recorded in the backlog table above and the source assignment should be reconciled. Reviewers and detailed descriptions should be checked in Jira issue details.

| Action | Owner | Due | Status |
|---|---|---:|---|
| Check PA3 TA feedback and record sourced feedback or a no-feedback self-audit | Nguyễn Đức Duy (`SCRUM-69`) | 12/11/2026 | Assigned; outcome pending. |
| Prepare Spec Kit artifacts for F-01 (`010` + `011`) | Mai Văn Hiển (`SCRUM-72`) | 13/11/2026 | Assigned; work pending. |
| Prepare Spec Kit artifacts for F-07 (`070`) | Nguyễn Đức Duy (`SCRUM-73`) | 13/11/2026 | Assigned; work pending. |
| Reconcile SCRUM-89 due date in the source assignment with the Jira date | Lê Quốc Hưng / team | Before the task is due | Open. |

#### Attendance and evidence note

Meeting attendance, duration/platform and the detailed discussion were not present in the evidence available when this report was updated. Add them from the team's actual meeting record if needed. The Jira screenshots supplied by the user are the evidence for the visible backlog items and assignee avatars; attach the original image files in the report package if they are available in the repository.
